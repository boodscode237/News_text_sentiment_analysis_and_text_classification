The categories depend on the selected dataset and can cover arbitrary subjects. Therefore, text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize any kind of text.

In general there are 3 types of classification:
* **Binary** classification
* **Multi-class** classification
* **Multi-label** classification

**Binary Classification:**

Binary classification involves categorizing data into two distinct groups or classes. It's a fundamental task in machine learning and NLP, with applications in sentiment analysis, spam detection, and medical diagnosis, among others.

**Multiclass Classification:**

Multiclass classification assigns each instance to one and only one class from a set of two or more classes. It's commonly used in document categorization, topic classification, and language identification tasks.

**Multilabel Classification:**

Multilabel classification assigns multiple labels to each instance, allowing for more nuanced and complex categorization. It's used in tasks where instances can belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

1. **Tag Recommendation:**
   - Tag recommendation involves predicting relevant tags or labels for a given piece of content, such as blog posts, articles, or images.

Then, they employ machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests to learn from the extracted features and make classification decisions. By integrating both rule-based and machine learning components, the hybrid approach aims to capitalize on the interpretability and domain knowledge of rule-based systems while leveraging the learning capabilities and generalization power of machine learning algorithms for improved classification performance.

In this article, we will focus on **Deep learning-based** systems and a GPT3 Transformer block.

These approaches can be used in a **supervised** or **unsupervised** learning settings.
* **Supervised Learning**: Common approaches use supervised learning to classify texts. These conventional text classification approaches usually require a large amount of **labeled** training data.

* **Unsupervised Learning**: In practice, however, an ***annotated*** text dataset for training state-of-the-art classification algorithms is often unavailable. The annotation (***labelling***) of data usually involves a lot of manual effort and high expenses. Therefore, unsupervised approaches offer the opportunity to run low-cost text classification for unlabeled dataset.

First, we will focus on the **Supervised Learning** methods since we have a ***labeled*** dataset.

Deep learning (DL) models commonly used in text classification:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**

  - CNNs are traditionally used in computer vision tasks but have also been adapted for text classification. In text classification, CNNs apply convolutional filters over word embeddings or character sequences to capture local and global patterns in the input text. They are particularly effective for capturing spatial hierarchies of features in text data.

   **Research Article:** "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" by Y. Kim.

   **Description:** In this paper, the author proposes a CNN architecture for sentence classification tasks. The model applies convolutional filters of varying widths over word embeddings to capture local and global features of input sentences. The resulting feature maps are then passed through max-pooling layers to extract the most salient features, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in achieving competitive performance on benchmark text classification datasets.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**
  - RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by processing input sequences one element at a time while maintaining a hidden state that captures contextual information. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are popular variants of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem and enable the modeling of long-range dependencies in text data. RNNs are well-suited for tasks where the order of words or characters matters, such as sentiment analysis and language modeling.

   **Research Article:** "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by I. Sutskever et al.

   **Description:** This paper introduces the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization. The model consists of an encoder RNN that reads input sequences and a decoder RNN that generates output sequences, enabling end-to-end learning of complex mappings between input and output sequences. While not specifically focused on text classification, RNNs can be adapted for classification tasks by adding a softmax layer on top of the final hidden states to predict class labels.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:**

   **Research Article:** "Long Short-Term Memory" by S. Hochreiter and J. Schmidhuber.

   **Description:** This seminal paper introduces the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs and capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs incorporate memory cells with self-connected recurrent units and gating mechanisms to selectively update and propagate information over time, making them well-suited for capturing temporal dynamics in text data. Researchers have applied LSTM networks to various text classification tasks, leveraging their ability to model sequential patterns and dependencies in input sequences.

4. **Transformer Models:**

   **Research Article:** "Attention is All You Need" by A. Vaswani et al.

   **Description:** This influential paper introduces the Transformer architecture, which relies solely on self-attention mechanisms without recurrent or convolutional layers, achieving state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks. Transformers utilize multi-head self-attention layers to capture global dependencies between input and output tokens efficiently, enabling parallelization and scalability across sequence lengths. Transformer-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) have been pretrained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for downstream text classification tasks, achieving remarkable performance across various benchmarks.
